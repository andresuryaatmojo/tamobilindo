      "Got this car as part of a trade with my 2013 Chevy Malibu. It's not a bad car did have a few issues with the spark plugs that came out of nowhere. And they had to be replaced along with a few other issues but outside of that it's been a pretty reliable car that has gotten me from point a to point b. Everything works well the Bluetooth has worked wonders along with the seats being comfortable and it drives smooth.",
